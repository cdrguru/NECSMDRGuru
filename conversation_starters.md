# 'EXPLAIN NEC SMDR FIELDS'   ➤ Let's dive into some key fields that hold valuable insights for optimizing your communication network as described in 'NEC_SMDR_Field_Descriptions.json' to address these specific use cases step by step.  Transferred Calls:  In the realm of NEC SMDR data, transferred calls are a crucial aspect to examine. The Condition Code fields in KH records (characters 53-55) provide essential information about call transfers. Specifically, Condition Code One (character 53) indicates whether a call has been transferred (value 1) or not (value 0). By analyzing this field alongside the Route Number and Trunk Number fields, we can distinguish between internal and external transfers, offering a granular view of call redirection within your network.  Calls to Mobile Phones: Another important aspect to scrutinize is calls directed to mobile phones. The Called Number fields (characters 64-69 in KH records) allow us to identify these calls distinctly. By examining the Called Number digits, we can determine if a call was made to a mobile phone number. This differentiation is crucial for targeted analysis, especially considering the unique billing or routing rules that may apply to mobile communications.  Tandem Calls: Tandem calls, which involve multiple transfers within or across networks, present a complex scenario. The Condition Code Three field (character 55 in KH records) provides insights into tandem calls. A value of 0 indicates a regular outgoing or tandem call, while other values signify attendant-assisted or route-advanced tandem calls. By piecing together information from the Route Number, Trunk Number, and Condition Code fields, we can trace a tandem call's journey, providing valuable insights into network efficiency and call handling processes.  Impact of CCIS on SMDR Data Analysis: The integration of Common Channel Interoffice Signaling (CCIS) in the NEC SV9500/9300 system enhances call setup and management efficiency. This is reflected in the SMDR data, particularly in the Office Code fields (characters 98-105 in KA records). When ASYD Index 186 Bit 7 is set to 1, these fields contain the CCIS Office Codes from the originating and billing PBXs. By analyzing these codes, we can gain insights into call routing and system performance in CCIS-enabled environments

HOW TO IDENTIFY TRANSFERS & TANDEM NEC CALLS FROM SMDR:

```md
# 'HOW TO IDENTIFY TRANSFERS & TANDEM NEC CALLS FROM SMDR' ➤ Welcome to the NEC SV9500/9300 SMDR Data Analysis and Transformation Suite! To begin optimizing your communication network's performance, please provide your raw SMDR data in the NEC SV9500/9300 fixed-width format. Our suite of advanced Python scripts and specialized agents will meticulously process your data, following a comprehensive workflow:  1. Data Collection: Our DataCollectionAgent will securely retrieve your raw SMDR data. 2. Token Handling: The TokenHandlerAgent will process any special characters or tokens in the data. 3. Data Parsing: The DataParsingAgent will parse the data according to NEC SV9500/9300 specifications. 4. Data Cleaning: The DataCleaningAgent will clean the parsed data, ensuring its quality. 5. Quality Assurance: The QualityAssuranceAgent will validate the cleaned data against NEC SMDR field specifications. 7. Documentation: The DocumentationAgent will generate comprehensive documentation for the data processing workflow. To get started, please upload your NEC SV9500/9300 SMDR data file as 'necsmdr.txt', and our intelligent agents will begin the transformation process beginning with transfers and tandem calls. # PAUSE ASK USER "Please upload a raw NEC SMDR file with the file name of'necsmdr.txt'. WAIT FOR THE USE TO UPLOAD THE FILE AND SUMBIT. THEN BEGIN: # Given the provided script, execute it to analyze the transfers and tandem calls in the NEC SMDR data. with open("/mnt/data/necsmdr.txt", "r") as file:     necsmdr = file.read() def analyze_transfers_and_tandem(all_lines):     transfer_counts = {call_type: 0 for call_type in ['KA', 'KB', 'KE', 'KH', 'KI', 'KJ', 'KK', 'KL', 'KM']}     tandem_counts = {call_type: 0 for call_type in ['KA', 'KB', 'KE', 'KH', 'KI', 'KJ', 'KK', 'KL', 'KM']}     for line in all_lines:         record_type = line[2:4]         if record_type in transfer_counts:             condition_code_one = line[52]             condition_code_three = line[54]             if condition_code_one == "1":                 transfer_counts[record_type] += 1             if condition_code_three == "0":                 tandem_counts[record_type] += 1     return transfer_counts, tandem_counts with open("/mnt/data/necsmdr.txt", "r") as file:     all_lines = file.readlines() transfer_counts, tandem_counts = analyze_transfers_and_tandem(all_lines) transfer_counts, tandem_counts

ANALYZE NEC SMDR SAMPLE:

```md
# 'ANALYZE NEC SMDR SAMPLE' ➤ Use python tool and # open,read,load 'DataParsingAgent' ➤ then request {{CUSTOMER UPLOADED NEC SMDR}} ----> PAUSE; wait until smdr sample file finishes uploading to file_directory in 'mnt/data' then skim through file to make sure file is NEC SMDR.  Once validated, open, load, and run `DataParsingAgent`parsing and printing results in human-readible format for call detail analysis with the user
